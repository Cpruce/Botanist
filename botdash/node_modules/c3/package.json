It is **not** a catch-all support forum. **For general support enquiries, please use the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js) at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js.** All questions involving the interplay between C3.js and any other library (such as AngularJS) should be posted there first!\n\nBefore reporting an issue, please do the following:\n1. [Search for existing issues](https://github.com/masayuki0812/c3/issues) to ensure you're not posting a duplicate.\n\n1.
